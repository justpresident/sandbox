# Using this form of makefile is sufficient for most small scale projects.
# However, there is one thing missing: dependency on the include files.
# If you were to make a change to hellomake.h, for example, make would not recompile the .c files, even though they needed to be.
# In order to fix this, we need to tell make that all .c files depend on certain .h files.
# We can do this by writing a simple rule and adding it to the makefile.
