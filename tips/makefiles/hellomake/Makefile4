# As a final simplification, let's use the special macros $@ and $^, which are the left and right sides of the :, respectively,
# to make the overall compilation rule more general.
# In the example below, all of the include files should be listed as part of the macro DEPS,
# and all of the object files should be listed as part of the macro OBJ.
